    Data storage class allowing setting, retrieval and unsetting of custom
    attributes. This class subclasses dict so the data can be accessed the same
    as you would a dictionary as well as using dot notation.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            >>> d = DataStore()
            >>> d.foo = "bar"
            >>> d.foo

            DataStore(foo='bar')
