    An implementation of :obj:`~.context.base.Context` for message context menu commands.

    Args:
        app (:obj:`~.app.BotApp`): The ``BotApp`` instance that the context is linked to.
        event (:obj:`~hikari.events.interaction_events.InteractionCreateEvent`): The event to create the context
            from.
        command (:obj:`~.commands.message.MessageCommand`): The command that the context is for.

    Note that the target message that this command was invoked on will **always** be stored
    as the option ``target``.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            @lightbulb.command("id", "Gets the ID of the selected message")
            @lightbulb.implements(lightbulb.MessageCommand)
