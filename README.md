## Description

Bobert is a personal bot I made a while back written in Python that is currently getting rewritten in hikari-py. The sole purpose that was intended for Bobert was to moderate [my server](https://discord.gg/Wm8zz5vukP) and have a confessions system but it can do so much more than that now.
